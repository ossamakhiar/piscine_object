# Piscine Object
The **Piscine Object** is a curated series of modules designed to impart crucial insights into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software architecture. Each module introduces fundamental concepts in a progressive manner, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of key principles. The sequential arrangement of modules is crucial for establishing a robust foundation.:

1. **[Module 00 - Encapsulation](module_00/README.md):**
   This module delves into the concept of encapsulation, emphasizing the importance of encapsulating data and functionality within objects.

2. **[Module 01 - Relationship](module_01/README.md):**
   Expanding on the previous module, this section explores how variables and attributes can be intricately linked through specific types of relationships, fostering a deeper understanding of object connections.

3. **Module 02 - UML (Unified Modeling Language):**
   An essential skill in software design, this module focuses on representing software architecture graphically using UML, providing a visual framework for effective communication.

4. **[Module 03 - SOLID](module_03/README.md):**
   This module demystifies the concept of SOLID, an acronym commonly used in the software development realm. Understanding the SOLID principles is crucial for designing maintainable and scalable software.

5. **[Module 04 - Design Patterns](module04/README.md):**
   Covering the renowned Gang of Four design patterns, this module equips learners with proven solutions to recurring design problems, fostering efficient and scalable software development.

6. **Module 05 - Practical Work:**
   The culmination of knowledge acquired in the preceding modules, this practical exercise challenges participants to apply their newfound skills and insights. It serves as a hands-on opportunity to reinforce theoretical understanding through real-world application.

By completing the **Piscine Object** modules in this prescribed order, participants will not only grasp the intricacies of OOP but also gain a holistic view of software architecture, setting the stage for proficient and effective software development practices.
