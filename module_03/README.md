# SOLID principles
SOLID is a set of rules, or guidelines, that allow you to produce code that is easier to read, understand and maintain.

Each letter in the word SOLID refers to a specific rule:
<ul>
<li>[S]ingle Responsibility Principle</li>
<li>[O]pen/Closed Principle</li>
<li>[L]iskov Substitution Principle</li>
<li>[I]nterface Segregation Principle</li>
<li>[D]ependency Inversion Principle</li>
</ul>

By following these principles, developers can create more flexible and modular software. It also reduces the coupling between different parts of the software, making it easier to maintain and evolve the code. The `SOLID` principles are therefore an essential tool for programmers who want to create high-quality, scalable and maintainable software.
